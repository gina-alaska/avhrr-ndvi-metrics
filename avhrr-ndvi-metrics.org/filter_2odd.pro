;this program filter out odd points in the vector v, one-year ndvi curve should be both sides are low and middle is hight.
;if ther are some points with very low values,
;they are considered as odd points, take them off and interpol them.
;input, v---vector,output: returned vector named rtr
; if minpoint-lowvalu > 0.4 take this point out

;jzhu, 9/13/2011, this program get rif of 1 or 2 consecutive odd points,
;odd points are defined they are 0.4 smaller than adjunctive points
;diffval=0.4
