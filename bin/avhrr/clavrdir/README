This directory contains the modularized components
of the CLAVR (CLouds from AVhrR) cloud detection
algorithm.

The cloud tests are:

rgct.pro - Reflective Gross Cloud Test

rrct.pro - Reflective Ration Cloud Test (actually this has been
           replaced by an NDVI test).

c3at.pro - Channel 3 Albedo Test

fmft.pro - Four Minus Five Test

tgct.pro - Thermal Gross Cloud Test


Associated with each test is an array of threshold values.
These thresholds are different for each dataset.  The threshold
arrays can be found in the following files.

tg96.dat - Tallgrass NOAA-14 1996 512x512 dataset
tg94.dat - Tallgrass NOAA-11 1994 100x100 dataset
nb94.dat - Niobrara  NOAA-11 1994 100x100 dataset


The thresholds in the above data files need to be interpolated
by date.  The array 'dat' contains the Julian day of the middle
of each month in order to do this interpolation.  The following
file is sourced in each of the tests:

dates.dat
