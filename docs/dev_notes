per Mike Budde's request, modify modis NDVI metrics algorithm into avhrr ndvi metrics algorithm named as avhrr_calculate_ndvi_metrics_by_raw_plus_smooth.pro. It take raw data time series (for example ak_nd_1998, ak_nd_1998.hdr) and smoothed time series (ak_nd_1998sm and ak_nd_1998sm.hdr). The smoothed time series is produced by swets smooth method. Swets smooth method includes two parameters, one is the regression window (-wr) which identifies the number of points to include the linear regression calculated a each point, and the other is the combination window (-wc) which identifies the number of regression lines to combine (average) for a smoothed data point. In the case of the AVHRR data that Mike have been working with, he have used a -wr of 5 and a -wc of 6.

develop avhrr ndvi algorithm named as avhrr_calculate_ndvi_metrics_by_raw.pro. It takes raw data time series (example ak_nd_1998sm and ak_nd_1998sm.hdr) only as input. uses modified swets smooth method to produce smoothed time series. then calcualte the NDVI metrics.

investigate how smooth method with different window parameters affect the NDVI metrics results.
